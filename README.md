# CV-capstone
Our Computer Vision project for CSC490H5 : Capstone Design Course  

# Introduction 
Considering that this course is focused on a capstone project, it was important for our team to step
out of our comfort zone and find ways to apply the knowledge acquired from previous courses into a
new realm of expertise such as healthcare. Brain tumours affect approximately 50,000 Canadians
every year, according to the Brain Tumour Registry of Canada (BTRC) [1]. Manual diagnosis
of brain tumours is time-intensive and requires specialized knowledge of the brain [2]. In order
to assist doctors in providing better care for neurology patients, we seek to develop automatic
methods for diagnosis of glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) scans. This entails a multi-class classification problem to which we hope to apply
machine learning techniques in new and insightful ways.
